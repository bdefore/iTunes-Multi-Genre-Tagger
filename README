iTunes Multi-Genre Tagger adds descriptive metadata to your music. These descriptive tags 
are gathered from the Last.FM API (no user account necessary) and then written into the
‘Grouping’ field of your music file(s).

And wherefore? To break old habits. With the ‘Grouping’ column displayed in iTunes, this
enables you to filter music by multiple categories, even very specific ones (i.e. "90s 
argentina indie") from within the iTunes search feature. In this way you’ll find music
you’d otherwise not think to listen to.

Dependencies:
rb-appscript (gem install rb-appscript)
